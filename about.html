    <p style="font-size:20px">At Sci4Teens, we realize that many teens across the globe are passionate about STEM, but need futher guidance on how to 
      communicate their research or their understanding of a certain topic. This is why Sci4Teens creates equal opportunities for students looking to pursue STEM and science communication through our writing contest, workshops, 
      and newsletter. We hope that through this organization, more teens will understand the importance of communicating their work, and can apply these skills in future careers.
